This repository contains the code used for the model in the paper [Implications of carbon source-sink feedbacks for plant growth responses to environmental factors](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.27.615358). The code is written in Fortran and there are three Python codes to draw the three data figures using output from the model.

**To compile the code:
```make```

**To then run the code:
```./sucrose.exe```

**To compile and run the code:
